      <h3>The Calydonian Boar Hunt</h3>
      <div class="story-container">
        <div class="story-text">
          <p>The first major event in Greek mythology where Atalanta appears is the Calydonian boar hunt. The king of the Greek region Calydon failed to honor Artemis, so the goddess got angry and summoned a demon boar to ravage his lands. The Calydonian Boar was one of the great monsters of Greek mythology, and many great male heroes came together to kill it. There was also a woman there: Atalanta, armed with her trusty bow and arrow, was the first hunter to wound the boar. When it was finally killed, the man who killed it, named Meleager, gave Atalanta the head and skin as a reward. Meleager also did this to profess his love, but unfortunately his jealous uncles tried to steal these trophies from Atalanta. Meleager killed his uncles, causing his own mother to kill him in revenge.</p>

      <h3>The Footrace</h3>
      <div class="story-container">
        <div class="story-text">
          <p>After helping kill the monstrous boar, Atalanta grew in fame. At this time, her father popped back into the picture and demanded she get married. Atalanta reluctantly agreed, but on the condition that the suitor must beat her at a footrace. Several footraces were held, but Atalanta was one of the fastest mortals in Greece, so she remained single. Also, she had a habit of spearing the suitors during the race if she caught up to them. Then along came Hippomenes, who is sometimes referred to in mythology as Melanion. Hippomenes knew he could not outrun Atalanta, so he went to the goddess of love, Aphrodite, for help. Aphrodite gave him three golden apples because she was offended by Atalanta's dislike of love. During the footrace, Hippomenes dropped the apples in front of Atalanta. Unable to resist, she stopped to pick up the beautiful apples, giving Hippomenes a chance to win the race. Aphrodite's cheat works, and Hippomenes wins the race.  For some reasons, Atalanta doesn't seem to hold it against him—perhaps she approves of his cleverness, as well as his athleticism.  Further, he seems to appreciate her: rather than trying to turn her into a traditional ancient wife, the two become comrades in hunting together.</p>

      <h3>Metamorphoses into Lions</h3>
      <div class="story-container">
        <div class="story-text">
          <p>After the footrace, Hippomenes forgot to thank Aphrodite for her aid, and while the couple were out hunting the goddess afflicted them with sexual passion so that they had sex in a sanctuary belonging to either Zeus or Rhea. They were turned into lions for their sacrilege by either Artemis (angered by Atalanta losing her virginity), the goddess Cybele, or Zeus himself. The belief at the time was that lions could not mate with their own species, only with leopards; therefore Atalanta and Hippomenes would never be able to have "intercourse of love".</p>
